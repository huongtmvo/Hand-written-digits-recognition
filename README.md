# Hand-written-digits-recognition
Build Deep Learning Model to recognize hand-written digits

## Project Objectives: 
- Explore MNIST dataset of handwritten digits from https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ 
- Build MLP, CNN models using Keras and fine-tune models to get high accuracy
- Test models on real world examples

## Results
- MLP solution: Accuracy is 98.15% on test set.
- CNN solution: Accuracy is 99.15% on test set. 
- Models perform well on real world examples
