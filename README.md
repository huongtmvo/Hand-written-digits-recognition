# Build Deep Learning Application to Recognize Handwritten Digits
The goal of the project is to experiment with state of the art machine learning techniques and to build the high accuracy model on test data. We also build an web application to test the model in real-time. 



## Project Objectives: 
- Explore MNIST dataset of handwritten digits from https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ 
- Build MLP, CNN models using Keras and fine-tune models to get high accuracy
- Test models on real world examples

## Results
- MLP solution: Accuracy is 98.15% on test set.
- CNN solution: Accuracy is 99.15% on test set. 
- Models perform well on real world examples
